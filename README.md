# Amstrad E3 Simulator 20th Anniversary
This is a home screen for Android thats basied on the Amstrad E3 Emailer Videophone home screen, I made it because my Amstrad E3 emailer deactivaed itself and I still want something like it on a Android 7inch Tablet and I was famular with it already so made it to replace it, I liked its clock and was use to it been there from 2004.

If you are interested in this and want to work on it to please contact me, not everyone is interseed in it because the Amstrad E3 Videophone was only released in the UK in 2004, its other models E1(1999) and E2(2002) were as well so only know about thses if you bought one from Dixons or Tesco at the time.

If anyone would like me to add the Amstrad E2 Emailer home screen into it to so you can switch models so you have the green monicrhome clock home screen I can but no point if no interest... :)
