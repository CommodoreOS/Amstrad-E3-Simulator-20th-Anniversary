# Amstrad E3 Simulator 20th Anniversary
This is a home screen for Android thats basied on the Amstrad E3 Videophone Emailer home screen, I made it because my Amstrad E3 Videophone deactivaed itself(in 3 months or less) and I still wanted something like it on a Android 7inch Tablet and I was famular with it already so made it to replace it, I liked its clock and was use to it been there from 2004.

And this allows you to continue to use the E3's Main Software without using a Amstrad E3 Vidophone thats 20 years old, the hardware will not last forever, that why we need simulators or emulators of old tec so it can still be used, so saves on the hardware, you just need a Android 7" inch Tablet, it can be run on a bigger tablet too, and this a part of britsh history and how a Amstrad E3 worked.

## To Do List

I want to add touch buttons on its home screen that open a app on Android so like a shourtcut to the Email/Gmail apps on Android.
but at the moment I do not know how to add it, looked online and on the Adobe Animate Help website and can't find anything about doing it or adding it.

If you are interested in this and want to work on it to please contact me, not everyone is intereseed in it so why I have not sheared its source code because the Amstrad E3 Videophone was only released in the UK in 2004, its other models E1(1999) and E2(2002) were as well so only know about thses if you bought one from Dixons or Tesco in the UK at the time.

If anyone would like me to add the Amstrad E2 Emailer home screen into it to so you can switch models so you have the green monicrhome clock home screen I can but no point if no interest... :)
